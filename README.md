### Dutch NA Task

This codebase generates parallel corpora in Dutch and English that can be used to check for number agreement in language models.

This repository contains the following resources:
- `vocabulary`: this folder contains tsv files with input words and their translation. The tsv headers look like one of the following:
	1. `en	nl`;
	2. `en_plural	en_singular	nl_plural	nl_singular`.
- `generate.py`: this Python script generates data given a certain template and executes the following steps:
	1. Retrieve vocabulary from the `vocabulary` folder;
	2. Based on the template, make Feature-Based NLTK Grammars in four variants of number (dis)agreement: singular-singular, plural-plural, singular-plural, plural-singular;
	3. Use one of the grammars to generate all sentences possible regardless of number agreement;
	4. Categorise the sentences generated by variant using a parser;
	5. Store sentence pairs that are eachother's agreeing or disagreeing version together in the output file, using the following header: `agreement\tdisagreement\tsubject_index\tverb_index\tcompleted`.
- `generate.sh`: this script executes all commands used to generate the data currently contained in the `generated_data` folder.
- `generated_data`: this folder contains the currently generated data for templates simple, adv, adv_adv, adv_conjunction, name_pp, noun_pp and noun_pp_adv. 

Examples in English:
```
agreement	disagreement	number	subject_index	verb_index	completed
The farmer above the dog greets The farmer above the dog greet	singular	1	5	The farmer above the dog greets the person.

The farmer above the dog understands	The farmer above the dog understand singular	1	5	The farmer above the dog understands the person.
```

Examples in Dutch:
